// We require the webpack package and the resolve functionality from the path package at the top of the file.
//
// The path library is a dependency of Webpack. It allows us to resolve file paths, as seen in lines above that read resolve(). Resolving a path is the act of providing a dedicated tool (like the path library) the name of a directory or file, and relying upon it to find the exact path.
//
// This allows us to say things like resolve('file_name') instead of ./../much/longer/filepath/to/the/file_name.js. It's essentially a shortcut, so we don't have to meticulously list the exact file path to each directory or file we need. As you can imagine, this can also prevent errors.

    "webpack/hot/only-dev-server",
    // instructs Webpack to bundle our code, then provide it to the development server if/when bundling is successful
    resolve(__dirname, 'src', 'index.jsx')
//     Within the module, we declare an entry specifying the file where the bundling process starts. Similar to the main.ts file we used in Angular, we specify that the entry point is index.jsx.
//
// An entry point is the file responsible for instructing the module bundler how to build the application. The browser loads this file first. Similar to a jQuery selector, our React app needs a place to reference in the DOM and manipulate as it renders our code.

    path: resolve(__dirname, 'build'),
  //  points it to a directory called build. The __dirname argument refers to the directory this webpack.config.js file is located in. When the file path is resolved, we provide it the location of this file's directory (with the __dirname shortcut), and the name of the directory we're trying to locate (build), and the path library resolves the exact file path for us.
    publicPath: '/'
    // This specifies where hot-reloaded modules should be loaded. This is actually the default publicPath configuration for a single page application like ours. That means HMR would technically work without this line. However, we explicitly include it to denote we're actively choosing the default path, /

By specifying the extensions here, we can later import files in our project without explicitly listing an extension. (ie,: require(myComponent) instead of: require(myComponent.jsx)). This is certainly not mandatory, but a helpful feature.
